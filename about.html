          <br>
            <p> Sparkstone creates and invests in trading algorithms to earn risk-adjusted returns in equity markets. </p>
              <p>All of our algorithms are crafted using our unique analytics platform, which allows us to rapidly iterate
            through our strategies and determine which ones will have the most success on the markets. Our system has the ability to trade and operate multiple strategies at a time, and automatically rebalances according to market conditions. </p>

          <br/>
          <p class="text-white">Our journey began in 2014 as a project amongst dorm mates to build high-performance trading algorithms. We looked for an analytics platform to support our efforts, but found nothing that met our requirements. Undeterred, we spent a year collaborating
            across dorm rooms, crafting our own proprietary platform to perfect our strategies and augment our data sources. Seeing what we had built, our aspirations grew, and we founded Sparkstone Analytics.</p>
          <br />
          <p class="text-white">Today, we are a passionate team pioneering algorithmic trading strategies, crafted with innovative analytics. We optimize our system daily, and rapidly iterate our algorithms to trade on the markets. Driven by our belief that the market rate
            of return is never good enough, we look forward to the challenges and late night coffee runs that will help us to build on our successes.</p>
